## Prerequisites

### Package Manager

This repo is based on Yarn3. Ensure that you have a global installation of
[Yarn3](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install#global-install). Note: The project uses `pnp` to ensure faster
installation of application dependencies in a monorepo setup.

You can test if yarn is installed correctly by using:

```sh
yarn --version
```

### Step 1: Install dependencies:

```sh
yarn
```

### Step 2: Setup the backend app:

Ensure that you have the backend running after checking out the code
from [here](https://github.com/giantswarm/fe-hiring-task-api).

### Step 3: Start the frontend app:

Start `ui-app-catalog` app

```sh
yarn start:frontend
```

### Step 4(Optional): Run storybook to display component library:

Start `lib-components` app

```sh
yarn start:storybook
```
